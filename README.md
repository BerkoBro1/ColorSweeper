# ColorSweeper
I don't remember the exact website I found that inspired me to make this game, but I can say I made it before it became a thing on GamePidgeon, so that's gotta count for something.
Very simple game - you start in the top left corner and use the buttons on the bottom to switch your color. If you switch to the same color as a tile adjacent to you, you gain that tile. The goal is to take all the tiles in the fewest moves. Have fun!
